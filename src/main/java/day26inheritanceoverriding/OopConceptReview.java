        1) Encapsulation:
            a) Data hiding
            b) By using private access modifier, we can hide data
            c) After hiding, if you want to read data from other classes, create "getters"
            d) After hiding, if you want to update from other classes, create "setters"
            e) To create objects from classes in Java, we have many ways:
                i) A obj1 = new A(); ==> Fixed object
               ii) A obj2 =  new A("Veli Han", 13);
              iii)

        2) Polymorphism: Overloading + Overriding
            a) Overloading: ...

            b) Overriding: ....

            c) What is the difference between "Overloading" and "Overriding"?
               i) Overloading does not need "inheritance", but inheritance is must for "Overriding".
              ii) private and static methods can be overloaded but private and static methods cannot be overridden
             iii) final methods can or cannot be overloaded.
              iv) Overloading happens in Compile Time, but Overriding happens in Run Time.
               v) Overloading is faster than Overriding.

        3) Inheritance:

        4) Abstraction:
